<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="dropcap"><span class="caps">The</span> favourable reception of &#8220;Literary Frivolities&#8221; by the Press has led to
the preparation of this work as a Sequel, in which the only sin so far
charged against the &#8220;Frivolities&#8221;&mdash;that of omission&mdash;will be found fully
atoned for.</p>

<p>Those curious in regard to the historical and literary accounts of several
of the various phases of composition exemplified in this work, will find
these fully enough noticed in &#8220;Literary Frivolities,&#8221; in which none of the
examples were strictly original, and had been gathered from many outlying
corners of the world of literature. In the present work, however, will be
found a number of pieces which have not hitherto been &#8220;glorified in type,&#8221;
and these have been furnished by various literary gentlemen, among whom
may be named Professor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span> E. H. Palmer and J. Appleton Morgan, LL.D., of New
York. Assistance in &#8220;things both new and old&#8221; has also been given by
Charles G. Leland, Esq. (Hans Breitmann), W. Bence Jones, Esq., J. F.
Huntingdon, Esq. (Cambridge, U.S.); whilst particular thanks are due to
Mr. Lewis Carroll for a kindly and courteous permission to quote from his
works.</p>

<p>With regard to a few of the extracts, the difficulty of finding their
authors has been a bar to requesting permission to use them; but in every
case endeavour has been made to acknowledge the source whence they are
derived.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><i>THE PARODY.</i></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="dropfig"><img src="images/cap_p.jpg" alt="P" /></span>arody is the name generally given to a humorous or burlesque imitation of
a serious poem or song, of which it so far preserves the style and words
of the original as that the latter may be easily recognised; it also may
be said to consist in the application of high-sounding poetry to familiar
objects, should be confined within narrow limits, and only adapted to
light and momentary occasions. Though by no means the highest kind of
literary composition, and generally used to ridicule the poets, still many
might think their reputation increased rather than diminished by the
involuntary applause of imitators and parodists, and have no objection
that their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> works afford the public double amusement&mdash;first in the
original, and afterwards in the travesty, though the parodist may not
always be intellectually up to the level of his prototype. Parodies are
best, however, when short and striking&mdash;when they produce mirth by the
happy imitation of some popular passage, or when they mix instruction with
amusement, by showing up some latent absurdity or developing the disguises
of bad taste.</p>

<p>The invention of this humoristic style of composition has been attributed
to the Greeks, from whose language the name itself is derived (<i>para</i>,
beside; <i>ode</i>, a song); the first to use it being supposed to be Hegemon
of Thasos, who flourished during the Peloponnesian War; by others the
credit of the invention is given to Hipponax, who in his picture of a
glutton, parodies Homer&#8217;s description of the feats of Achilles in fighting
with his hero in eating. This work begins as follows:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="table">
<tr><td>&#8220;Sing, O celestial goddess, Eurymedon, foremost of gluttons,<br />
Whose stomach devours like Charybdis, eater unmatched among mortals.&#8221;</td></tr></table>

<p>The Battle of the Frogs and Mice (The &#8220;Batrachomyomachia&#8221;), also a happy
specimen of the parody is said to be a travesty of Homer&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> &#8220;Iliad,&#8221; and
numerous examples will be found in the comedies of Aristophanes. Among the
Romans this form of literary composition made its appearance at the period
of the Decline, and all the power of Nero could not prevent Persius from
parodying his verses. The French among modern nations have been much given
to it, whilst in the English language there are many examples, one of the
earliest being the parodying of Milton by John Philips, one of the most
artificial poets of his age (1676-1708). He was an avowed imitator of
Milton, and certainly evinced considerable talent in his peculiar line.
Philips wrote in blank verse a poem on the victory of Blenheim, and
another on Cider, the latter in imitation of the Georgics. His best work,
however, is that from which there follows a quotation, a parody on
&#8220;Paradise Lost,&#8221; considered by Steele to be the best burlesque poem
extant.</p>

Where, mindful of the nymph, whose wanton eye<br />
Transfixed his soul, and kindled amorous flames,<br />
Chloe or Phillis, he each circling glass<br />
Wishes her health, and joy, and equal love.<br />
Meanwhile he smokes, and laughs at merry tale,<br />
Or pun ambiguous, or conundrum quaint.<br />
But I, whom griping penury surrounds,<br />
And hunger, sure attendant upon want,<br />
With scanty offals, and small acid tiff,<br />
Wretched repast! my meagre corpse sustain:<br />
Then solitary walk, or doze at home<br />
In garret vile, and with a warming puff<br />
Regale chilled fingers; or from tube as black<br />
As winter chimney, or well-polished jet,<br />
Exhale mundungus, ill-perfuming scent:<br />

With looks demur, and silent pace, a dun,<br />
Horrible monster! hated by gods and men,<br />
To my aërial citadel ascends:<br />
With vocal heel thrice thundering at my gate;<br />
With hideous accent thrice he calls; I know<br />
The voice ill-boding, and the solemn sound.<br />
What should I do? or whither turn? Amazed,<br />
Confounded, to the dark recess I fly<br />
Of wood-hole; straight my bristling hairs erect<br />
Through sudden fear: a chilly sweat bedews<br />
My shuddering limbs, and (wonderful to tell!)<br />
My tongue forgets her faculty of speech;<br />
So horrible he seems! His faded brow<br />
Intrenched with many a frown, and conic beard,<br />
And spreading band, admired by modern saints,<br />
Disastrous acts forebode; in his right hand<br />
Long scrolls of paper solemnly he waves,<br />
With characters and figures dire inscribed,<br />
Grievous to mortal eyes (ye gods, avert<br />
Such plagues from righteous men!) Behind him stalks<br />
Another monster, not unlike himself,<br />
Sullen of aspect, by the vulgar called<br />
A catchpoll, whose polluted hands the gods<br />
With force incredible, and magic charms,<br />
First have endued: if he his ample palm<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>Should haply on ill-fated shoulder lay<br />
Of debtor, straight his body, to the touch<br />
Obsequious (as whilom knights were wont),<br />
To some enchanted castle is conveyed,<br />
Where gates impregnable, and coercive chains<br />
In durance strict detain him, till, in form<br />
Of money, Pallas sets him free.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beware, ye debtors! when ye walk, beware,</span><br />
Be circumspect; oft with insidious ken<br />
This caitiff eyes your steps aloof, and oft<br />
Lies perdue in a nook or gloomy cave,<br />
Prompt to enchant some inadvertent wretch<br />
With his unhallowed touch. So (poets sing)<br />
Grimalkin, to domestic vermin sworn<br />
An everlasting foe, with watchful eye<br />
Lies nightly brooding o&#8217;er a chinky gap,<br />
Portending her fell claws, to thoughtless mice<br />
Sure ruin. So her disembowelled web<br />
Arachne, in a hall or kitchen, spreads<br />
Obvious to vagrant flies: she secret stands<br />
Within her woven cell; the humming prey,<br />
Regardless of their fate, rush on the toils<br />
Inextricable; nor will aught avail<br />
Their arts, or arms, or shapes of lovely hue:<br />
The wasp insidious, and the buzzing drone,<br />
And butterfly, proud of expanded wings<br />
Distinct with gold, entangled in her snares,<br />
Useless resistance make: with eager strides<br />
She towering flies to her expected spoils:<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>Then, with envenomed jaws, the vital blood<br />
Drinks of reluctant foes, and to her cave<br />
Their bulky carcasses triumphant drags.&#8221;...</td></tr></table>

<p>Perhaps the best English examples of the true parody&mdash;the above being more
of an imitation&mdash;are to be found in the &#8220;Rejected Addresses&#8221; of the
brothers James and Horace Smith. This work owed its origin to the
reopening of Drury Lane Theatre in 1812, after its destruction by fire.
The managers, in the true spirit of tradesmen, issued an advertisement
calling for Addresses, one of which should be spoken on the opening night.
Forty-three were sent in for competition. Overwhelmed by the amount of
talent thus placed at their disposal, the managers summarily rejected the
whole, and placed themselves under the care of Lord Byron, whose
composition, after all, was thought by some to be, if not unworthy, at
least ill-suited for the occasion. Mr. Ward, the secretary of the Theatre,
having casually started the idea of publishing a series of &#8220;Rejected
Addresses,&#8221; composed by the most popular authors of the day, the brothers
Smith eagerly adopted the suggestion, and in six weeks the volume was
published, and received by the public with enthusiastic delight. They were
principally humorous imitations of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> eminent authors, and Lord Jeffrey said
of them in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>: &#8220;I take them indeed to be the very best
imitations (and often of difficult originals) that ever were made; and,
considering their great extent and variety, to indicate a talent to which
I do not know where to look for a parallel. Some few of them descend to
the level of parodies; but by far the greater part are of a much higher
description.&#8221; The one which follows is in imitation of Crabbe, and was
written by James Smith, and Jeffrey thought it &#8220;the best piece in the
collection. It is an exquisite and masterly imitation, not only of the
peculiar style, but of the taste, temper, and manner of description of
that most original author.&#8221; Crabbe himself said regarding it, that it &#8220;was
admirably done.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr., as he was commonly called, Byrom, seems to have been an amiable and
excellent man, and his friends after his death in September 1763 collected
and published all the verses of his they could lay hands on, in 2 vols.
12mo, at Manchester in 1773. A more complete edition was issued in 1814.
Many of Byrom&#8217;s poems evince talent, but a great part are only calculated
for private perusal: his &#8220;Diary&#8221; and &#8220;Remains&#8221; were published by the
Chetham Society (1854-57). Byrom was the inventor of a successful system
of shorthand. He was a decided Jacobite, and his mode of defending his
sentiments on this point are still remembered and quoted:</p>

<h2><i>MACARONIC VERSE.</i></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="dropfig"><img src="images/cap_m.jpg" alt="M" /></span>acaronic verse is properly a system of Latin inflections joined to words
of a modern vernacular, such as English, French, German, &amp;c.; some
writers, however, choose to disregard the strictness of this definition,
and consider everything macaronic which is written with the aid of more
than one language or dialect. Dr. Geddes (born 1737; died 1802),
considered one of the greatest of English macaronic writers, says: &#8220;It is
the characteristic of a Macaronic poem to be written in Latin hexameters;
but so as to admit occasionally vernacular words, either in their native
form, or with a Latin inflection&mdash;other licenses, too, are allowed in the
measure of the lines, contrary to the strict rules of prosody.&#8221; Broad
enough reservations these, of which Dr. Geddes in his own works was not
slow in availing himself, and as will be seen in the specimens given, his
example has been well followed, for the strict rule that an English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
macaronic should consist of the vernacular made classical with Latin
terminations has been as much honoured in the breach as in the observance.
Another characteristic in macaronics is that these poems recognise no law
in orthography, etymology, syntax, or prosody. The examples which here
follow are confined exclusively to those which have their basis, so to
speak, in the English language, and, with the exception of a few of the
earlier ones, the majority of the selections in this volume have their
origin in our own times.</p>

<p>&#8220;The earliest collection of English Christmas carols supposed to have been
published,&#8221; says Hone&#8217;s &#8220;Every Day Book,&#8221; &#8220;is only known from the last
leaf of a volume printed by Wynkyn Worde in 1521. There are two carols
upon it: &#8216;A Carol of Huntynge&#8217; is reprinted in the last edition of Juliana
Berners&#8217; &#8216;Boke of St. Alban&#8217;s;&#8217; the other, &#8216;A carol of bringing in the
Bore&#8217;s Head,&#8217; is in Dibdin&#8217;s edition of &#8216;Ames,&#8217; with a copy of the carol
as it is now sung in Queen&#8217;s College, Oxford, every Christmas Day.&#8221; Dr.
Bliss of Oxford printed a few copies of this for private circulation,
together with Anthony Wood&#8217;s version of it. The version subjoined is from
a collection imprinted at London, &#8220;in the Poultry, by Richard Kele,
dwelling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span> at the long shop vnder Saynt Myldrede&#8217;s Chyrche,&#8221; about 1546:</p>

Mighty slick were the vessels progressing, jactata per æquora ventis,<br />

<h2><i>LINGUISTIC VERSE.</i></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="dropfig"><img src="images/cap_o.jpg" alt="O" /></span>ne of the most curious efforts in the way of teaching a language was that
attempted by a work published originally in Paris, in 1862, entitled &#8220;O
Novo Guia em Portuguez e Inglez. Par Jose de Fonseca e Pedro Carolina,&#8221; or
the New Guide to Conversation in Portuguese and English. Mr. G. C. Leland
writes us that Fonseca &#8220;manufactured&#8221; this work by procuring a book of
French dialogues, which he put word by word into English&mdash;(by the aid of
a dictionary)&mdash;&#8220;of which he knew not a word, and what is strangest, did
not learn a word, even while writing his <i>Guide</i>. That he really humbugged
his bookseller appears from this that he induced the poor victim to
publish a large English dictionary!&#8221; This book has been reprinted, as a
literary curiosity, and may be had at Quaritch&#8217;s, 15 Piccadilly, London,
under the title of &#8220;A New Guide to the English,&#8221; by Pedro Carolina;
Fonseca having taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span> his name out, and dating the book from
&#8220;Pekin,&#8221;&mdash;this being a mere joke. However, the original was a serious
work, and by way of introduction to a poem in the Fonseca English, kindly
given us by Professor E. H. Palmer, we give a few particulars of and
extracts from the work itself, and here is the Preface:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;A choice of familiar dialogues, clean of gallicisms and despoiled
phrases, it was missing yet to studious portuguese and brazilian
Youth; and also to persons of other nations that wish to know the
portuguese language. We sought all we may do, to correct that want,
composing and divising the present little work in two parts. The first
includes a greatest vocabulary proper names by alphabetical order; and
the second forty-three Dialogues adapted to the usual precisions of
the life. For that reason we did put, with a scrupulous exactness, a
great variety own expressions to english and portugues idioms; without
to attach us selves (as make some others) almost at a literal
translation; translation what only will be for to accustom the
portuguese pupils, or foreign, to speak very bad any of the mentioned
idioms. We were increasing this second edition with a phraseology, in
the first part, and some familiar letters, anecdotes, idiotisms,
proverbs, and to second a coin&#8217;s index.</p>

<p>&#8220;The <i>Works</i> which we were confering for this labour, find use us for
nothing; but those what were publishing to Portugal, or out. They were
almost all composed <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>for some foreign, or for some national little
acquainted in the spirit of both languages. It was resulting from that
corelessness to rest these <i>Works</i> fill of imperfections and anomalies
of style; in spite of the infinite typographical faults which
sometimes invert the sense of the periods. It increase not to contain
any of those <i>Works</i> the figured pronunciation of the english words,
nor the prosodical accent in the portugese: indispensable object whom
wish to speak the english and portuguese languages correctly.</p>

<p>&#8220;We expect then who the little book (for the care what we wrote him,
and for her typographical correction) that may be worth the acceptance
of the studious persons, and especially of the Youth, at which we
dedicate him particularly.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>The &#8220;greatest vocabulary proper names&#8221; is in three columns&mdash;the first
giving the Portuguese, the second the English words, and the third the
English pronunciation:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">
<tr><td>Dô Múndo.</td>
    <td><span class="spacer">&nbsp;</span></td>
    <td>Of the world.</td>
    <td><span class="spacer">&nbsp;</span></td>
    <td>Ove thi Ueurlde.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Os astros.</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>The stars.</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>Thi esters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Môça.</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>Young girl.</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>Yeun-gue guerle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>O relâmpago.</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>The flash of lightning.</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>Thi flax ove lait eningue.</td></tr></table>

<p>The vocabulary fills about fifty pages, and is followed by a series of
&#8220;familiar phrases,&#8221; of which a few are here given:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Do which is that book? Do is so kind to tell me it. Let us go on ours
feet. Having take my leave, i<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span> was going. This trees make a beauty
shade. This wood is full of thief&#8217;s. These apricots make me &amp; to come
water in mouth. I have not stricken the clock. The storm is go over,
the sun begin to dissape it. I am stronger which him. That place is
too much gracious. That are the dishes whose you must be and to
abstain.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>Then come the dialogues, and one we give is supposed to take place at a
morning call, which commences first with the visitor and the servant:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;&#8216;Is your master at home?&#8217;&mdash;&#8216;Yes, sir.&#8217; &#8216;Is it up?&#8217;&mdash;&#8216;No, sir, he
sleep yet. I go make that he get up.&#8217; &#8216;It come in one&#8217;s? How is it you
are in bed yet?&#8217;&mdash;&#8216;Yesterday at evening I was to bed so late that i
may not rising me soon that morning.&#8217;&#8221;</p></div>

<p>This is followed by a description of the dissipation which led to these
late hours&mdash;&#8220;singing, dancing, laughing, and playing&#8221;&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;&#8216;What game?&#8217;&mdash;&#8216;To the picket.&#8217; &#8216;Who have prevailed upon?&#8217;&mdash;&#8216;I have
gained ten lewis.&#8217; &#8216;Till at what o&#8217;clock its had play one?&#8217;&mdash;&#8216;Untill
two o&#8217;clock after midnight.&#8217;&#8221;</p></div>

<p>But these conversations or dialogues, however amusing, are as nothing when
compared with the anecdotes which are given by Fonseca, of which we
transcribe a few:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>&#8220;John II., Portugal King, had taken his party immediately. He had in
her court castillians ambassadors coming for treat of the pease. As
they had keeped in leng the negotiation he did them two papers in one
from which he had wrote <i>peace</i> and on the other <i>war</i>&mdash;telling them
&#8216;Choice you!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Philip, King&#8217;s Macedonia, being fall, and seeing the extension of her
body drawed upon the dust was cry&mdash;&#8216;Greats Gods! that we may have
little part in this Univers!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One eyed was laied against a man which had good eyes that he saw
better than him. The party was accepted. &#8216;I had gain over,&#8217; said the
one eyed; &#8216;why i see you two eyes, and you not look me who one!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The most vertious of the pagans, Socrates, was accused from impiety,
and immolated to the fury of the envy and the fanaticism. When relates
one&#8217;s him self that he has been condemned to death for the
Athenians&mdash;&#8216;And then told him, they are it for the nature,&mdash;But it is
an unjustly,&#8217; cried her woman &#8216;would thy replied-him that might be
justify?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cæsar seeing one day to Roma, some strangers, very riches, which bore
between her arms little dogs and little monkeies and who was
carressign them too tenderly was ask, with so many great deal reason,
whether the women of her country don&#8217;t had some children?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Two friends who from long they not were seen meet one&#8217;s selves for
hazard. &#8216;How do is there?&#8217; told one of the two. &#8216;No very well, told
the other, and i am married from that I saw thee.&#8217; &#8216;Good news.&#8217; &#8216;Not
quit, because <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>I had married with a bad woman.&#8217; &#8216;So much worse.&#8217; &#8216;Not
so much great deal worse; because her dower was from two thousand
lewis.&#8217; &#8216;Well, that confort.&#8217; &#8216;Not absolutely, why i had emplored this
sum for to buy some muttons which are all deads of the rot.&#8217; &#8216;That is
indeed very sorry.&#8217; &#8216;Not so sorry, because the selling of hers hide
have bring me above the price of the muttons.&#8217; &#8216;So you are
indemnified.&#8217; &#8216;Not quit, because my house where i was disposed my
money, finish to be consumed by the flames.&#8217; &#8216;Oh, here is a great
misfortune!&#8217; &#8216;Not so great nor i either, because my wife and my house
are burned together!&#8217;&#8221;</p></div>

<p>The concluding portion of this Guide is devoted to &#8220;Idiotisms and
Proverbs,&#8221; of some of which it is rather difficult to recognise the
original, as &#8220;To take time by the forelock,&#8221; is rendered &#8220;It want to take
the occasion for the hairs!&#8221; Here are a few others:</p>

<p>&#8220;He is like the fish into the water.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To buy a cat in a pocket.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To come back at their muttons.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is not so devil as he is black.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep the chestnut of the fire with the hand of the cat.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pidgin English is the name given to the dialect extensively used in the
seaport towns of China as a means of communication between the natives and
English and Americans, and is a very rude jargon in which English words
are very strangely distorted. It is very limited, the Chinese learning
Pidgin with only the acquirement of a few hundred words, the pronunciation
and grammar of which have been modified to suit those of their own
language. The word Pidgin itself is derived through a series of changes in
the word <i>Business</i>. Early traders made constant use of this word, and the
Chinaman contracted it first to <i>Busin</i>, and then through the change to
<i>Pishin</i> it at length assumed the form of <i>Pidgin</i>, still retaining its
original meaning. This at once shows the difficulty which a Chinaman has
in mastering the pronunciation of English words, and as business or
commerce is the great bond of union between the Chinese and the foreign
residents, it is not to be wondered at that this word should give name to
the jargon formed in its service. The Chinese have great difficulty in
using the letter <i>r</i>, pronouncing it almost always like <i>l</i>, as <i>loom</i> for
<i>room</i>, <i>cly</i> for <i>cry</i>; and for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span> sake of euphony often add <i>ee</i> or
<i>lo</i> to the end of words. <i>Galaw</i> or <i>galow</i> is a word of no meaning,
being used as a kind of interjection; <i>chop, chop</i>, means quick, quick;
<i>maskee</i>, don&#8217;t mind; <i>chop b&#8217;long</i>, of a kind; <i>topside galow</i>,
excelsior, or &#8220;hurrah for topside&#8221;; <i>chin chin</i>, good-bye; <i>welly culio</i>,
very curious; <i>Joss-pidgin-man</i>, priest. With these few hints the reader
may understand better the following version of &#8220;Excelsior,&#8221; which
originally appeared in <i>Harpers&#8217; Magazine</i> in 1869,&mdash;the moral, however,
belongs solely to the Chinese translator:</p>

<p>In connection with these linguistic curiosities we take the following from
an old number of <i>Harpers&#8217; Magazine</i>: &#8220;A practical parent objects to the
silliness of our nursery rhymes, for the reason that the doggerel is
rendered pernicious by the absence of a practical moral purpose, and as
introducing infants to the realities of life through an utterly erroneous
medium. They are taught to believe in a world peopled by Little Bo-peeps
and Goosey, Goosey Ganders, instead of a world of New York Central, Erie,
North-Western Preferred, &amp;c. &amp;c. It is proposed, therefore, to accommodate
the teaching of the nursery to the requirements of the age, to invest
children&#8217;s rhymes with a moral purpose. Instead, for example, of the blind
wonderment as to the nature of astronomical bodies inculcated in that
feeble poem commencing &#8216;Twinkle, twinkle, little star,&#8217; let the child be
indoctrinated into the recent investigations of science, thus:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">

For the spectrum renders clear<br />
Gaps within your photosphere,<br />
Also sodium in the bar<br />
Which your rays yield, solar star.&#8217;</td></tr></table>

<p>&#8220;Then, again, there is the gastronomic career of Little Jack Homer, which
inculcates gluttony. It is practicable that this fictitious hero should
familiarise the child with the principles of the <i>Delectus</i>:</p>

<p>&#8220;The episode of Jack and Jill is valueless as an educational medium. But

<p>&#8220;Even the pleasures of life have their duties, and the child needs to be

might be impressed upon the female mind at an early age in the following

<p>The preceding is all very well, but there are others which have been
travestied and changed also&mdash;&#8220;Mary&#8217;s little Lamb,&#8221; for instance, will
never be allowed to rest in its true Saxon garb, but is being constantly
dressed in every tongue and dialect. But recently one has arisen bold
enough to doubt the story altogether, and throw discredit on the song. Mr.
Baring Gould, and iconoclasts like him, strive to show that William Tell
and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span> ancient heroes never did live, but we never expected to doubt
the existence of &#8220;Mary&#8217;s little Lamb,&#8221; yet a correspondent to a magazine
sent not long ago what he says is the &#8220;true story of Mary and her lamb,&#8221;
hoping it will take the place of the garbled version hitherto received as
authentic:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose fleece was white as snow,</span><br />
And every place that Mary went,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The lamb it would <i>not</i> go.</span><br />
<br />
So Mary took that little lamb,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And beat it for a spell;</span><br />
The family had it fried next day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And it went very well.&#8221;</span></td></tr></table>

<p>We have still another way of it, in what may be termed an exaggerated
synonymic adherence to the central idea of the ballad:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">

for the system of nomenclature they have pursued, in so far as introducing
such names as Deptford, Codrington, Greenwich, and so on. Conceding that
there may be some confusion by the duplication in this way of names from
the old country, they are surely better than the jaw-breaking native names
which are strung together in the following lines:</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All in the State of Maine,</span><br />
A man from Wittequergaugaum came<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One evening in the rain.</span><br />
<br />
&#8216;I am a traveller,&#8217; said he,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&#8216;Just started on a tour,</span><br />
And go to Nomjamskillicook<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To-morrow morn at four.&#8217;</span><br />
<br />
He took a tavern-bed that night,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And with the morrow&#8217;s sun,</span><br />
By way of Sekledobskus went,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With carpet-bag and gun.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span><br />
A week passed on; and next we find<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our native tourist come</span><br />
To that sequester&#8217;d village called<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Genasagarnagum.</span><br />
<br />
From thence he went to Absequoit,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And there&mdash;quite tired of Maine&mdash;</span><br />
He sought the mountains of Vermont,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon a railroad train.</span><br />
<br />
Dog Hollow, in the Green Mount State,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was his first stopping-place,</span><br />
And then Skunk&#8217;s Misery displayed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Its sweetness and its grace.</span><br />
<br />
By easy stages then he went<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To visit Devil&#8217;s Den;</span><br />
And Scrabble Hollow, by the way,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Did come within his ken.</span><br />
<br />
Then <i>via</i> Nine Holes and Goose Green,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He travelled through the State,</span><br />
And to Virginia, finally,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was guided by his fate.</span><br />
<br />
Within the Old Dominion&#8217;s bounds,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He wandered up and down;</span><br />
To-day at Buzzard Roost ensconced,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To-morrow at Hell Town.</span><br />
<br />
At Pole Cat, too, he spent a week,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till friends from Bull Ring came,</span><br />
And made him spend the day with them<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In hunting forest game.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span><br />
Then, with his carpet-bag in hand,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To Dog Town next he went;</span><br />
Though stopping at Free Negro Town,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where half a day he spent.</span><br />
<br />
From thence, into Negationburg<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His route of travel lay,</span><br />
Which having gained, he left the State<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And took a southward way.</span><br />
<br />
North Carolina&#8217;s friendly soil<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He trod at fall of night,</span><br />
And, on a bed of softest down,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He slept at Hell&#8217;s Delight.</span><br />
<br />
Morn found him on the road again,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To Lousy Level bound;</span><br />
At Bull&#8217;s Tail, and Lick Lizard too,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Good provender he found.</span><br />
<br />
The country all about Pinch Gut<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So beautiful did seem,</span><br />
That the beholder thought it like<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A picture in a dream.</span><br />
<br />
But the plantations near Burnt Coat<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were even finer still,</span><br />
And made the wond&#8217;ring tourist feel<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A soft delicious thrill.</span><br />
<br />
At Tear Shirt, too, the scenery<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Most charming did appear,</span><br />
With Snatch It in the distance far,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Purgatory near.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span><br />
But spite of all these pleasant scenes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The tourist stoutly swore</span><br />
That home is brightest after all,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And travel is a bore.</span><br />
<br />
So back he went to Maine, straightway<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A little wife he took;</span><br />
And now is making nutmegs at<br />

newspapers, which, however profound or dense, invariably have a corner for

<p>&#8220;About the year 1775 there was a performer named Cervetti in the orchestra
of Drury Lane Theatre, to whom, the gods had given the appropriate name of
Nosey, from his enormous staysail, that helped to carry him before the
wind. &#8216;Nosey!&#8217; shouted from the galleries, was the signal, or word of
command, for the fiddlers to strike up. This man was originally an Italian
merchant of good repute; but failing in business, he came over to England,
and adopted music for a profession. He had a notable knack of loud
yawning, with which he sometimes unluckily filled up Garrick&#8217;s expressive
pauses, to the infinite annoyance of Garrick and the laughter of the
audience. In the summer of 1777 he played at Vauxhall, at the age of
ninety-eight.&#8221; Upon such another nose was the following lines written:</p>

<p>Moore, in his &#8220;Life of Sheridan,&#8221; says that he (Sheridan) &#8220;had a sort of
hereditary fancy for difficult trifling in poetry; particularly to that
sort which consists in rhyming to the same word through a long string of
couplets, till every rhyme that the language supplies for it is
exhausted,&#8221; a task which must have required great patience and
perseverance. Moore quotes some dozen lines entitled &#8220;To Anne,&#8221; wherein a
lady is made to bewail the loss of her trunk, and she thus rhymes her
lamentations:</p>

<p>John Skelton, a poet of the fifteenth century, in great repute as a wit
and satirist, was inordinately fond of writing in lines of three or four
syllables,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span> and also of iteration of rhyme. This perhaps was the cause of
his writing much that was mere doggerel, as this style scarcely admits of
the conveyance of serious sentiment. Occasionally, however, his miniature
lines are interesting, as in this address to Mrs. Margaret Hussey:</p>

<h2><i>ANAGRAMS.</i></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="dropfig"><img src="images/cap_a.jpg" alt="A" /></span>nagrams are curious and frequently clever examples of formal literary
trifling. Camden, in his &#8220;Remains,&#8221; gave to the world a treatise showing
that in his day anagrams were endowed with an undue and superstitious
importance, being regarded as nothing less than the occult and mysterious
finger of Fate, revealed in the names of men.</p>

<p>&#8220;The only quintessence,&#8221; says this old writer, &#8220;that hitherto the alchemy
of wit could draw out of names, is <i>anagrammatisme</i> or <i>metagrammatisme</i>,
which is the dissolution of a name, truly written, into the letters as its
elements, and a new connection of it by artificial transposition, without
addition, subtraction, or change of any letter, into different words,
making some perfect sense applicable to the person named.&#8221; Precise
anagrammatists adhere strictly to these rules, with the exception of
omitting or retaining the letter <i>h</i> according to their convenience,
alleging that <i>h</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span> cannot claim the rights of a letter; others, again,
think it no injury sometimes to use <i>e</i> for <i>æ</i>, <i>v</i> for <i>w</i>, <i>s</i> for <i>z</i>,
<i>c</i> for <i>k</i>, and contrariwise, and several of the instances which follow
will be found variously imperfect. Camden calls the charming difficulty of
making an anagram, &#8220;the whetstone of patience to them that shall practise
it; for some have been seen to bite their pen, scratch their head, bend
their brows, bite their lips, beat the board, tear their paper, when the
names were fair for somewhat, and caught nothing therein,&mdash;yet,
notwithstanding the sour sort of critics, good anagrams yield a delightful
comfort and pleasant motion to honest minds.&#8221;</p>

<p>Camden places the origin of the anagram as far back as the time of Moses,
and conjectures that it may have had some share in the mystical
traditions, afterwards called the &#8220;Cabala,&#8221; communicated by the Jewish
lawgiver. One part of the art of the cabalists lay in what they called
<i>themuru</i>&mdash;that is, changing&mdash;or finding the hidden and mystical meaning
in names, which they did by transposing and fantastically combining the
letters in those names. Thus of the letters of Noah&#8217;s name in Hebrew they
made <i>Grace</i>, and of the Messiah&#8217;s <i>He shall rejoice</i>. Whether the above
origin be theoretical or not, the anagram can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span> traced to the age of
Lycophron, a Greek writer, who flourished about 300 <span class="smcaplc">B.C.</span></p>

<p>Among the moderns, the French have most cultivated the anagram. Camden
says: &#8220;They exceedingly admire the anagram, for the deep and far-fetched
antiquity and mystical meaning therein. In the reign of Francis the First
(when learning began to revive), they began to distil their wits therein.&#8221;
There is a curious anecdote of an anagrammatist who presented a king of
France with the two following upon his name of Bourbon:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="table">
<tr><td>Borbonius,</td>
    <td rowspan="2" align="center"><span class="spacer">&nbsp;</span>or<span class="spacer">&nbsp;</span></td>
    <td>Borbonius,</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Bonus orbi</i>;</td>
    <td><i>Orbus boni</i>;</td></tr></table>

<p>That is, &#8220;Bourbon good to the world;&#8221; or &#8220;Bourbon destitute of good;&#8221;
while on another celebrated Frenchman we have&mdash;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">
<tr><td>Voltaire,<br />
<i>O alte vir</i>.</td></tr></table>

<p>Southey, in his &#8220;Doctor,&#8221; says that &#8220;anagrams are not likely ever again to
hold so high a place among the prevalent pursuits of literature as they
did in the seventeenth century. But no person,&#8221; he continues, &#8220;will ever
hit upon an apt one without feeling that degree of pleasure with which any
odd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span> coincidence is remarked.&#8221; In that century, indeed, the artifice
appears to have become the fashionable literary passion of the day&mdash;the
amusement of the learned and the wise, who sought</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">
<tr><td><span style="margin-left: 4em;">&#8220;To purchase fame,</span><br />
In keen iambics and mild anagram.&#8221;</td></tr></table>

<p>While Andreas Rudiger was yet a student at college, and intending to
become a physician, he one day pulled the Latinised form of his name to
pieces, Andreas Rudigeras, and borrowing an <i>i</i>, transposed it into <i>Arare
Rus Dei Dignus</i> (&#8220;Worthy to cultivate the land of God&#8221;). He fancied from
this that he had a divine call to become an ecclesiastic, and thereupon
gave up the study of medicine for theology. Soon after, Rudiger became
tutor in the family of the philosopher Thomasius, who one day told him
&#8220;that he would greatly benefit the journey of his life by turning it
towards physic.&#8221; Rudiger confessed that his tastes lay rather in that
direction than to theology, but having looked upon the anagram of his name
as an indication of a divine call, he had not dared to turn away from
theology. &#8220;How simple you have been,&#8221; replied Thomasius; &#8220;it is just that
very anagram which calls you towards medicine&mdash;&#8216;<i>Rus Dei</i>,&#8217; the land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span> of
God (God&#8217;s acre), what is that but the cemetery&mdash;and who labours so
bravely for the cemetery as a physician does?&#8221; Rudiger could not resist
this, returned to medicine, and became famous as a physician.</p>

<p>An anagram on Monk, afterwards Duke of Albemarle on the restoration of
Charles II., forms also a chronogram, including the date of the event it
records&mdash;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">
<tr><td>Georgius Monke, Dux de Aumarle&mdash;<br />
<i>Ego Regem reduxi, anno sa</i> <span class="smcaplc">MDCLVV</span>.</td></tr></table>

<p>In this anagram the <i>c</i> takes the place of the <i>k</i>.</p>

<p>The old Puritan biographer, Cotton Mather, claims for John Wilson&mdash;the
subject of one of his lives&mdash;the kingship of anagrammatising. &#8220;Of all the
anagrammatisers,&#8221; he says in the third book of his &#8220;Magnalia Christi
Americana,&#8221; &#8220;that have been trying their fancies for the 2000 years that
have run out since the days of Lycophron, or the more than 5000 since the
days of our first father, I believe there never was a man that made so
many, or so nimbly, as our Mr. Wilson; who, together with his quick turns
upon the names of his friends, would ordinarily <i>fetch</i>, and rather than
<i>lose</i>, would even <i>force</i>, devout instructions out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span> his anagrams. As
one, upon hearing my father (Increase Mather) preach, Mr. Wilson
immediately gave him that anagram upon his name &#8216;Crescentius Matherus,&#8217;
<i>Eu! Christus Merces Tua</i> (Lo! Christ is thy reward). There would scarcely
occur the name of any remarkable person without an anagram raised
thereupon.&#8221;</p>

<p>This said John Wilson &#8220;forced instruction&#8221; out of his own name&mdash;first
rendering it into Latin, Johannes Wilsonus, he found this anagram in it,
&#8220;<i>In uno Jesu nos salvi</i>&#8221; (We are saved in one Jesus). This mode of
Latinising names was common enough among those who liked this literary
folly; thus we have Sir Robert Viner, or Robertus Vinerus, rendered &#8220;<i>Vir
Bonus et Rarus</i>&#8221; (a good and rare man). The disciples of Descartes made a
perfect anagram upon the Latinised name of their master, &#8220;Renatus
Cartesius,&#8221; one which not only takes up every letter, but which also
expresses their opinion of that master&#8217;s speciality&mdash;&#8220;<i>Tu scis res
naturæ</i>&#8221; (Thou knowest the things of nature).</p>

<p>Pierre de St. Louis became a Carmelite monk on discovering that his name
yielded a direction to that effect:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">
<tr><td>Ludovicus Bartelemi&mdash;<br />
<i>Carmelo se devolvit</i>.</td></tr></table>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>And, in the seventeenth century, André Pujom, finding that his name
spelled <i>Pendu à Riom</i>, fulfilled his destiny by cutting somebody&#8217;s throat
in Auvergne, and was actually hung at Riom, the seat of justice in that
province.</p>

<p>Occasionally when the anagram of a name did not make sense, there was
added a rhyme to bring out a meaning. Thus, in a sermon preached by Dr.
Edward Reynolds upon Peter Whalley, and entitled &#8220;Death&#8217;s Advantage,&#8221;
every letter of the name is to be found in the first line of this verse:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">
<tr><td>&#8220;<i>They reap well</i>,<br />
That Heaven obtain;<br />
Who sow like thee,<br />
Ne&#8217;er sow in vain.&#8221;</td></tr></table>

<p>In this sermon Peter Whalley is also anagrammatised into <i>A Whyte
Perle</i>&mdash;this would not be a bad one, if orthography were of as little
consequence as many of the old triflers in this way used to account it.</p>

<p>We read that when Alexander the Great was baffled before the walls of
Tyre, and was about to raise the siege, he had a dream wherein he saw a
satyr leaping about and trying to seize him. He consulted his sages, who
read in the word Satyrus (the Greek for satyr), &#8220;<i>Sa Tyrus</i>&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;Tyre is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
thine!&#8221; Encouraged by this interpretation, Alexander made another assault
and carried the city.</p>

<p>In a &#8220;New Help to Discourse&#8221; (London, 1684), there is one with a very
quaint exposition:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Toast&mdash;A Sott.</span></p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">
<tr><td>&#8220;A <i>toast</i> is like <i>a sot</i>; or what is most<br />
Comparative, <i>a sot</i> is like a <i>toast</i>;<br />
For when their substances in liquor sink,<br />
Both properly are said to be in drink.&#8221;</td></tr></table>

<p>It will be seen, however, that anagrams have chiefly been made upon proper
names, and a reversing of their letters may sometimes pay the owner a
compliment; as of the poet Waller:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">
<tr><td>&#8220;His brows with laurel need not to be bound,<br />
Since in his <i>name</i> with <i>laurel</i> he is crowned.&#8221;</td></tr></table>

<p>George Thompson, the well-known anti-slavery advocate, was at one time
solicited to go into parliament for the more efficient serving of the
cause he had so much at heart. The question whether he would comply with
this request or not was submitted to his friends, and one of them gave the
following for answer:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">
<tr><td>George Thompson,<br />
<i>O go, the Negro&#8217;s M.P.</i>!</td></tr></table>

<p>This clever instance was given in &#8220;Notes and Queries&#8221; a short time ago:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">

<p>When, at the General Peace of 1814, Prussia absorbed a portion of Saxony,
the king issued a new coinage of rix dollars, with their German name, <i>Ein

Reich stahl er</i>, made a sentence of which the meaning is, &#8220;He stole a

regarded as an extraordinary coincidence, if nothing more. Many anagrams

<h2><i>THE ACROSTIC.</i></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="dropfig"><img src="images/cap_a.jpg" alt="A" /></span>crostic is the Greek name given to a poem the first letters of the lines
in which taken together form a complete word or sentence, but most
frequently a name. The invention of this kind of composition cannot be
traced to any particular individual, but it is believed to have originated
on the decline of pure classic literature. The early French poets, from
the time of Francis I. to that of Louis XIV., practised it, but it was
carried to its greatest perfection by the Elizabethan poets. Sir John
Davies has no fewer than twenty-six poems entitled &#8220;Hymns to Astræa,&#8221;
every one of which is an acrostic on the words, &#8220;Elizabetha Regina.&#8221;
Traces of something akin are to be found in the poetry of the Jews,&mdash;for
example, the 119th Psalm,&mdash;and also in the Greek &#8220;Anthology.&#8221; Here it may
be noted that in Greek the word <i>Adam</i> is compounded of the initial
letters of the four cardinal points:</p>

    <td>south;</td></tr></table>

<p>and that the Hebrew word, ADM forms the acrostic of A[dam], D[avid],
M[essiah].</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to give many specimens of this kind of literary
composition in these days, since there are so many periodicals continually
giving acrostics and relative verses, and a very few instances may
suffice. The following old verses were originally written in a copy of
Parkhurst&#8217;s poems presented by the author to Thomas Buttes, who himself
wrote this acrostic on his own name:</p>

<p>Mr. Swinburne, of whose style there has been given an imitation, is not
the only poet who is prone to alliteration&mdash;in fact, all poets are given
more or less to it, though not to the same extent. When used excessively
it is as disagreeable as any other excess, yet its occasional use
unquestionably adds to grace and style.</p>

alliterative&mdash;</p>

<h2><i>LIPOGRAMS.</i></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reading of Lope de Vega&#8217;s five novels, in each of which a different
vowel is omitted, led to Lord Holland writing the following curious
production, in which no vowel is used but <i>e</i>:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Eve&#8217;s Legend.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Men were never perfect; yet the three brethren Veres were ever
esteemed, respected, revered, even when the rest, whether the select
few, whether the mere herd, were left neglected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>&#8220;The eldest&#8217;s vessels seek the deep, stem the element, get pence; the
keen Peter when free, wedded Hester Green,&mdash;the slender, stern,
severe, erect Hester Green. The next, clever Ned, less dependent,
wedded sweet Ellen Heber. Stephen, ere he met the gentle Eve, never
felt tenderness: he kept kennels, bred steeds, rested where the deer
fed, went where green trees, where fresh breezes greeted sleep. There
he met the meek, the gentle Eve; she tended her sheep, she ever
neglected self; she never heeded pelf, yet she heeded the shepherds
even less. Nevertheless, her cheek reddened when she met Stephen; yet
decent reserve, meek respect, tempered her speech, even when she
showed tenderness. Stephen felt the sweet effect: he felt he erred
when he fled the sex, yet felt he defenceless when Eve seemed tender.
She, he reflects, never deserved neglect; she never vented spleen; he
esteems her gentleness, her endless deserts; he reverences her steps;
he greets her:</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me whence these meek, these gentle sheep,&mdash;whence the yet
meeker, the gentler shepherdess?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well bred, we were eke better fed, ere we went where reckless men
seek fleeces. There we were fleeced. Need then rendered me
shepherdess, need renders me sempstress. See me tend the sheep, see me
sew the wretched shreds. Eve&#8217;s need preserves the steers, preserves
the sheep; Eve&#8217;s needle mends her dresses, hems her sheets; Eve feeds
the geese; Eve preserves the cheese.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Her speech melted Stephen, yet he nevertheless esteems, reveres her.
He bent the knee where her feet <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>pressed the green; he blessed, he
begged, he pressed her.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Sweet, sweet Eve, let me wed thee; be led where Hester Green, where
Ellen Heber, where the brethren Vere dwell. Free cheer greets thee
there; Ellen&#8217;s glees sweeten the refreshments; there severer Hester&#8217;s
decent reserve checks heedless jests. Be led there, sweet Eve.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Never! we well remember the Seer. We went where he dwells&mdash;we
entered the cell&mdash;we begged the decree,&mdash;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">
<tr><td>&#8220;&#8216;Where, whenever, when, &#8217;twere well<br />
Eve be wedded? Eld Seer, tell!</td></tr></table>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;He rendered the decree; see here the sentence decreed!&#8217; Then she
presented Stephen the Seer&#8217;s decree. The verses were these:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">
<tr><td>&#8220;&#8216;<i>Ere the green be red,<br />
Sweet Eve, be never wed;<br />
Ere be green the red cheek,<br />
Never wed thee, Eve meek.</i>&#8217;</td></tr></table>

<p>&#8220;The terms perplexed Stephen, yet he jeered them. He resented the
senseless credence, &#8216;Seers never err.&#8217; Then he repented, knelt,
wheedled, wept. Eve sees Stephen kneel, she relents, yet frets when
she remembers the Seer&#8217;s decree. Her dress redeems her. These were the
events:</p>

<p>&#8220;Her well-kempt tresses fell: sedges, reeds beckoned them. The reeds
fell, the edges met her cheeks; her cheeks bled. She presses the green
sedge where her cheek bleeds. Red then bedewed the green reed, the
green reed then speckled her red cheek. The red cheek <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>seems green,
the green reed seems red. These were the terms the Eld Seer decreed
Stephen Vere.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcaplc">HERE ENDETH THE LEGEND.</span>&#8221;</p></div>

<p>The following curious lines run in quite an opposite way to the preceding,
for each verse has been written so as to include every letter in the
alphabet but the vowel <i>e</i>:</p>

<h2><i>WATCH-CASE VERSES.</i></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="dropfig"><img src="images/cap_w.jpg" alt="W" /></span>hen thick watches with removable cases were in fashion, and before the
introduction of the present compact form, the outer case of the
old-fashioned &#8220;turnip&#8221; was frequently the repository of verses and sundry
devices, generally placed there by the watchmaker. Others, again,
consisted of the maker&#8217;s name and address, with some appropriate maxim,
and were printed on satin or worked with the needle, and occasionally so
devised as to appear in a circle without a break, as in the following:</p>

address of Bowen, 2 Tichborne Street, Piccadilly, on a pedestal surmounted
by an urn. On the other side of the label was a winged figure, holding in
one hand a watch at arm&#8217;s length, and in the other a book. At her feet lay
a sickle and a serpent with his tail in his mouth&mdash;the emblems of Time and
Eternity. Round the circumference of the label were these lines&mdash;</p>

<p>The bottom of the case was lined with rose-coloured satin, on which was a

<h2><i>PROSE POEMS.</i></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="dropfig"><img src="images/cap_s.jpg" alt="S" /></span>everal pages of this kind appeared at the end of an early volume of
&#8220;Cornhill Magazine,&#8221; of which this is the beginning:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">To Correspondents.</span></p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis in the middle of the night; and as with weary hand we write,
&#8216;Here endeth C. M. volume seven,&#8217; we turn our grateful eyes to heaven.
The fainting soul, oppressèd long, expands and blossoms into song; but
why &#8217;twere difficult to state, for here commenceth volume eight.</p>

<p>&#8220;And ah! what mischiefs him environ who claps the editorial tiar on!
&#8217;Tis but a paper thing, no doubt; but those who don it soon find out
the weight of lead&mdash;ah me, how weary!&mdash;one little foolscap sheet may
carry. Pleasing, we hear, to gods and man was Mr. William Gladstone
when he calmed the paper duty fuss; but oh, &#8217;twas very hard on Us.
Before he took the impost off, one gentleman was found enough (he
<i>was</i> Herculean, but still!&mdash;) to bear the letters from Cornhill: two
men are needed now, and these are clearly going at the knees. Yet
happy hearts had we to-day if one in fifteen hundred, say, of all the
packets, white and blue, which we diurnally go through, yielded an
ounce of sterling brains, or ought but headache for our pains. Ah,
could the Correspondent see the Editor in his misery, no more
injurious ink he&#8217;d shed, but tears of sympathy instead.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span> What is this
tale of straws and bricks? A hen with fifty thousand chicks clapt in
Sahara&#8217;s sandy plain to peck the wilderness for grain&mdash;in that unhappy
fowl is seen the despot of a magazine. Only one difference we find;
but that is most important, mind. Instinct compels <i>her</i> patient beak;
ours&mdash;in all modesty we speak&mdash;is kept by <span class="smcap">Conscience</span> (sternly chaste)
pegging the literary waste. Our barns are stored, our garners&mdash;well,
the stock in them&#8217;s considerable; yet when we&#8217;re to the desert
brought, again comes back the welcome thought that somewhere in its
depths may hide one little seed, which, multiplied in our half-acre on
Cornhill, might all the land with gladness fill. Experience then no
more we heed; but, though we seldom find the seed, we read, and read,
and read, and read.&#8221; &amp;c. &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>This is also an instance of this hidden verse in the beginning of one of
Macaulay&#8217;s letters to his sister Hannah:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">My Darling</span>,&mdash;Why am I such a fool as to write to a gipsy at
Liverpool, who fancies that none is so good as she if she sends one
letter for my three? A lazy chit, whose fingers tire in penning a page
in reply to a quire! There, miss, you read all the first sentence of
my epistle, and never knew that you were reading verse.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>When Mr. Coventry Patmore&#8217;s &#8220;Angel in the House&#8221; was first published, the
&#8220;Athenæum&#8221; furnished the following unique criticism:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>&#8220;The gentle reader we apprise, That this new Angel in the House
Contains a tale not very wise, About a person and a spouse. The
author, gentle as a lamb, Has managèd his rhymes to fit, And haply
fancies he has writ Another &#8216;In Memoriam.&#8217; How his intended gathered
flowers, And took her tea and after sung, Is told in style somewhat
like ours, For delectation of the young. But, reader, lest you say we
quiz The poet&#8217;s record of his she, Some little pictures you shall see,
Not in our language but in his:</p>

<p>Fear not this saline Cousin Fred; He gives no tragic mischief birth;
There are no tears for you to shed, Unless they may be tears of mirth.
From ball to bed, from field to farm, The tale flows nicely purling

The rest will come another day, If public <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>sympathy allows; And this

<p>&#8220;He drew his breath with a gasping sob, with a quivering voice he
sang, but his voice leaked out and could not drown the accompanist&#8217;s
clamorous bang. He lost his pitch on the middle A, he faltered on the
lower D, and foundered at length like a battered wreck adrift on the
wild high C.&#8221;</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pony Lost.</span></p>
<p class="center"><i>On Feb. 21st, 1822, this devil bade me adieu.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Lost, stolen, or astray, not the least doubt but run away, a mare
pony that is all bay,&mdash;if I judge pretty nigh, it is about eleven
hands high; full tail and mane, a pretty head and frame; cut on both
shoulders by the collar, not being soft nor hollow; it is about five
years old, which may be easily told; for spirit and for speed, the
devil cannot her exceed.&#8221;</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>An excellent specimen of this kind of literary work is to be found in J.
Russell Lowell&#8217;s &#8220;Fable for Critics,&#8221; of which the title-page and preface
are written in this fashion, and there is here given an extract from the
latter:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Having scrawled at full gallop (as far as that goes) in a style that
is neither good verse nor bad prose, and being a person whom nobody
knows, some people will say I am rather more free with my readers than
it is becoming to be, that I seem to expect them to wait on my leisure
in following wherever I wander at pleasure,&mdash;that, in short, I take
more than a young author&#8217;s lawful ease, and laugh in a queer way so
like Mephistopheles, that the public will doubt, as they grope through
my rhythm, if in truth I am making fun <i>at</i> them or <i>with</i> them.</p>

<p>&#8220;So the excellent Public is hereby assured that the sale of my book is
already secured. For there is not a poet throughout the whole land,
but will purchase a copy or two out of hand, in the fond expectation
of being amused in it, by seeing his betters cut up and abused in it.
Now, I find, by a pretty exact calculation, there are something like
ten thousand bards in the nation, of that special variety whom the
Review and Magazine critics call <i>lofty</i> and <i>true</i>, and about thirty
thousand (<i>this</i> tribe is increasing) of the kinds who are termed
<i>full of promise</i> and <i>pleasing</i>. The public will see by a glance at
this schedule, that they cannot expect me to be over-sedulous about
courting <i>them</i>, since it seems I have got enough fuel made sure of
for boiling my pot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>&#8220;As for such of our poets as find not their names mentioned once in my
pages, with praises or blames, let them send in their cards, without
further delay, to my friend G. P. Putnam, Esquire, in Broadway, where
a list will be kept with the strictest regard to the day and the hour
of receiving the card. Then, taking them up as I chance to have time
(that is, if their names can be twisted in rhyme), I will honestly
give each his proper position, at the rate of one author to each new
edition. Thus, a premium is offered sufficiently high (as the
Magazines say when they tell their best lie) to induce bards to club
their resources and buy the balance of every edition, until they have
all of them fairly been run through the mill.&#8221; &amp;c. &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>That which is considered, however, one of the best of Prose Poems is the
following, which appeared originally in <i>Fraser&#8217;s Magazine</i>, and will also
be found in Maclise and Maginn&#8217;s &#8220;Gallery of Illustrious Literary
Characters,&#8221;<a name='fna_11' id='fna_11' href='#f_11'><small>[11]</small></a> being part of the introductory portion of a notice of the
late Earl of Beaconsfield, then Mr. Disraeli, and known at the time as an
aspirant to literary and political fame:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;O Reader dear! do pray look here, and you will spy the curly hair,
and forehead fair, and nose so high, and gleaming eye, of Benjamin
D&#8217;Is-ra-e-li, the wondrous boy who wrote <i>Alroy</i> in rhyme and prose,
only to show how long ago victorious Judah&#8217;s lion-banner rose. In an
earlier day he wrote <i>Vivian Grey</i>&mdash;a smart <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>enough story, we must
say, until he took his hero abroad, and trundled him over the German
road; and taught him there not to drink beer, and swallow schnapps,
and pull mädschen&#8217;s caps, and smoke the cigar and the meersham true,
in alehouse and lusthaus all Fatherland through, until all was blue,
but talk secondhand that which, at the first, was never many degrees
from the worst,&mdash;namely, German cant and High Dutch sentimentality,
maudlin metaphysics, and rubbishing reality. But those who would find
how Vivian wined with the Marchioness of Puddledock, and other great
grandees of the kind, and how he talked æsthetic, and waxed eloquent
and pathetic, and kissed his Italian puppies of the greyhound breed,
they have only to read&mdash;if the work be still alive&mdash;Vivian Grey, in
volumes five.</p>

<p>&#8220;As for his tentative upon the <i>Representative</i>, which he and John
Murray got up in a very great hurry, we shall say nothing at all,
either great or small; and all the wars that thence ensued, and the
Moravian&#8217;s deadly feud; nor much of that fine book, which is called
&#8216;the Young Duke,&#8217; with his slippers of velvet blue, with clasps of
snowy-white hue, made out of the pearl&#8217;s mother, or some equally fine
thing or other; and &#8216;Fleming&#8217; (<i>Contarini</i>), which will cost ye but a
guinea; and &#8216;Gallomania&#8217; (get through it, can you?) in which he made
war on (assisted by a whiskered baron&mdash;his name was Von Haber, whose
Germanical jabber, Master Ben, with ready pen, put into English smart
and jinglish), King Philippe and his court; and many other great works
of the same sort&mdash;why, we leave them to the reader to peruse; that is
to say, if he should choose.</p>

<p>&#8220;He lately stood for Wycombe, but there Colonel <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>Grey did lick him, he
being parcel Tory and parcel Radical&mdash;which is what in general mad we
call; and the latest affair of his we chanced to see, is &#8216;What is he?&#8217;
a question which, by this time, we have somewhat answered in this our
pedestrian rhyme. As for the rest,&mdash;but writing rhyme is, after all, a
pest; and therefore&#8221;&mdash;&mdash;</p></div>

<p>Some years ago <i>Punch</i> gave &#8220;revised versions&#8221; of a few of the old popular

Many heads had the monster, and tails not a few,<br />

&#8220;<i>LITERARY FRIVOLITIES, FANCIES, FOLLIES, AND FROLICS</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center">(Uniform with the present volume, post 8vo, cloth limp, 2s. 6d.)</p>


<p>&#8220;This is a new volume of the popular Mayfair Library, and it well deserves
its place. In such a book selection and arrangement are everything.... Mr.
Dobson really knows what to choose and what to reject; he has also a
feeling for good arrangement, and has made a most attractive volume....
For an odd half-hour or for a long journey we could hardly imagine
anything better, and we trust the book may find the encouragement it so
well deserves.&#8221;&mdash;<i>British Quarterly Review.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Literary Frivolities&#8217; is an absolutely delightful companion for an
unoccupied half-hour. It is a book which may with equal pleasure be read
all through or dipped into at any point, and the collection of literary
triflings it supplies is admirably ample.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Gentleman&#8217;s Magazine.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;This is a pleasant and amusing little volume. It contains a great deal of
curious information, and shows a very creditable amount of research.... We
may end as we began, by commending &#8216;Literary Frivolities&#8217; as a capital
book of its sort.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Athenæum.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;This latest volume of the bright little &#8216;Mayfair Library&#8217; is an
entertaining contribution to the literature of &#8216;inert hours,&#8217; and will
sufficiently initiate its readers into all the mysteries of bouts-rimés,
palindromes, lipograms, centones and figurate poems.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Notes and
Queries.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;A more delightful little work it has seldom been our lot to take in hand.
Mr. Dobson has made a study of all the eccentricities and frivolities
which have from time to time been perpetrated by writers in prose and
verse.... Mr. Dobson had gone into his work in a catholic spirit, and has
done it with great neatness and ability. It would be difficult to commend
the book too highly. It is a volume alike for holiday purposes, and for
other purposes more serious in connection with literature.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Scotsman.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Dobson has done his work well.... The book is very interesting and
entertaining, and has a still higher claim to our regard as a curious
chapter in the history of literature.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Examiner.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Not a few of the pages will raise a hearty laugh, and this fact alone
disposes us to regard the book with marked favour. A good index has not
been forgotten, and the volume in all ways reflects high credit on its
author.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Brief.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;This is a queer collection of interesting nothings, a record of some of
the literary playthings wherewith men have sought at one time and another
to beguile the road towards the darkness. Here are quips and cranks,
strange forms of prose and verse; monstrosities of rhythms. It is all very
interesting, and shows a heavy amount of research on the part of the
compiler.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Vanity Fair.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Great fun is shown in almost every page of &#8216;Literary Frivolities.&#8217;... The
&#8216;Mayfair Library&#8217; will do well if it gives us many books like Mr.
Dobson&#8217;s.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Graphic.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;It is quite certain that there have been thousands of not only
intelligent, but grave and learned persons who have taken pride as well as
pleasure in the accomplishment of such exploits, and that there are tens
of thousands who will be greatly entertained, if not roused to emulation,
by the pretty little volume consecrated to the commemoration and to
illustrative samples of those exploits.... It is provided with an index, a
very useful addition, and it is undoubtedly a bright, amusing, and not
altogether uninstructive publication.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Illustrated London News.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Dobson deserves credit for the pains he has taken.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Spectator.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;A miscellaneous and highly amusing collection of literary
curiosities.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Bookseller.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;An amusing volume.... An account of a great many of those curious puzzles
and tasks in which the literary mind delights.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Teacher.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;A collection, a most exhaustive one, of the vagaries indulged in from
remote ages down to the present day by literary triflers.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Whitehall
Review.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;A very entertaining little book.... Exceedingly interesting, and may be
heartily recommended.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Nottingham Guardian.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;A capital little book.... A cheap and neat volume which no editor or
printer should be without.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Printing Times and Lithograther.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;One of the most quaintly amusing books we have seen for a long
time.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Edinburgh Evening Express.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;For a man or woman endowed with literary tastes, and who, for want of
regular work to do, sometimes longs for new methods of &#8216;killing time,&#8217;
this collection of frivolities and oddities might prove a fruitful source
of amusement. Its author is a scholarly and well-read man; and in
preparing this book he must have put himself to an infinitude of
pains.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Edinburgh Daily Review.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;The little volume is pleasantly and learnedly written.&#8221;&mdash;<i>One and All.</i></p>

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
